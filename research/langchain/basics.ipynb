      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters the atmosphere**: When the sun rises, its light travels through space and into our atmosphere.\n",
      "2. **Light interacts with gases**: The sunlight encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) in the atmosphere. These molecules scatter the light in all directions.\n",
      "3. **Scattering occurs**: The shorter (blue) wavelengths of light are scattered more than the longer (red) wavelengths due to a process called Rayleigh scattering. This is because the smaller molecules are more effective at scattering shorter wavelengths.\n",
      "4. **Blue light is distributed evenly**: As a result, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its blue appearance.\n",
      "5. **Red light continues straight**: Meanwhile, the longer wavelengths of light (such as red and orange) continue to travel in a straight line, reaching our eyes from a more direct path.\n",
      "\n",
      "This scattering effect is why the sky appears blue during the day, especially when the sun is overhead. The color of the sky can change depending on the time of day, atmospheric conditions, and other factors, but this basic principle explains why the sky typically appears blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that the exact shade of blue we see in the sky can vary due to factors like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Atmospheric pollution and dust particles\n",
      "* Water vapor and humidity\n",
      "* Air pressure and temperature gradients\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the fundamental principle of scattering remains the same.\n"
