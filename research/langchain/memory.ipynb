For example, you could mention the work being done on multimodal LLMs that can process and generate text, images, and audio simultaneously.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you have a working prototype of your LLM model, you could demonstrate its capabilities by having it respond to a few questions or prompts. This would give your customer a tangible understanding of how the technology works and what kind of applications it could be used for in the future.\\n\\nWould you like me to suggest some specific demo ideas or examples based on your current project?\""
